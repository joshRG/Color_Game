## [How it Works](#how-it-works)
Web app based on python's framework, django. 

The web app is based mostly in JavaScript, where all the operations takes place 

The app is basically a display of a random rgb code generated in js and display and placed randomly in the 6 positions (in hard dificulty mode) and listening the event of a click in the squared selected by the user.
